AI implemented raid frame for 2.4.3

## Project intent

* Our primary goal is to create a robust framework for testing the interface layout.
* We will use dummy data when possible or necessary to ensure the interface is thoroughly tested.
* This approach will help us identify and resolve any issues early in the development process, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.
